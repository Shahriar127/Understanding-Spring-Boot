## Documentation


1. **What is Spring Boot?**

Answer: Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It provides a set of conventions and defaults to quickly set up and run applications with minimal configuration. It includes embedded servers, automatic configuration, and a range of starter dependencies to streamline development. 

2. **How does Spring Boot work? - Architecture**

Answer: Spring Boot's architecture is designed to simplify the development process. It works by:
Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath. It reduces the need for manual configuration.
Embedded Servers: Provides embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so you can run your application without needing to deploy it to a standalone server.
Starter POMs: Uses starter POMs (Project Object Models) to include common dependencies and simplify dependency management.
Spring Boot CLI: Allows running and testing Spring Boot applications from the command line.
Actuator: Provides built-in endpoints for monitoring and managing the application in production.

3. **What is Maven, and why is it used in Java projects?**

Answer: Maven is a build automation and project management tool used in Java projects. It simplifies the build process by managing project dependencies, building and packaging applications, and ensuring consistency across different environments. It provides a standardized project structure and integrates with various development and deployment tools.

4. **What is a simple API in Spring Boot?**

Answer: A simple API in Spring Boot is a straightforward RESTful API that uses Spring Boot's features to handle HTTP requests and responses. It allows you to expose endpoints for CRUD operations and interact with clients over HTTP. Spring Boot simplifies API development with automatic configuration and embedded servers.

5. **What is the purpose of the application.properties file in a Spring Boot application?**

Answer: The application.properties file is used to configure various settings in a Spring Boot application. It allows you to set properties for database connections, server ports, logging levels, and other application-specific settings. It helps in managing configurations in a central place.

6. **Why is Postman used for API testing, and are there alternatives?**

Answer: Postman is used for API testing because it provides a user-friendly interface to send HTTP requests, view responses, and debug APIs. Alternatives to Postman include tools like cURL (a command-line tool for making HTTP requests), Insomnia (a REST client with advanced features), and HTTPie (a command-line HTTP client).

7. **What is database mapping in Spring Boot, and what are its categories?**

Answer: Database mapping in Spring Boot involves associating Java objects with database tables. The main categories are:
One-to-One: A single record in one table is associated with a single record in another table.
One-to-Many: A single record in one table is associated with multiple records in another table.
Many-to-One: Multiple records in one table are associated with a single record in another table.
Many-to-Many: Multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table, often through a join table.

8. **What is JPA (Java Persistence API)?**

Answer: JPA is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It provides a standard way to map Java objects to database tables and handle CRUD operations. Implementations of JPA, such as Hibernate, work with Spring Data JPA to simplify data access in Spring Boot applications.

9. **What is the role of the data access layer in a Spring Boot project?**

Answer: The data access layer manages interactions with the database, handling operations such as querying, updating, and deleting data. It abstracts the database operations from the business logic, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to maintain and test.

10. **What is H2, and why is it important as an in-memory database? What are its previous and alternative technologies?**

Answer: H2 is an in-memory database written in Java, used primarily for development and testing due to its lightweight and fast nature. It allows for quick setup and testing without the need for an external database server. Previous technologies include SQLite, while other alternatives include Apache Derby and HSQLDB.

11. **What are database mappings and their categories?**

Answer: Database mappings define how Java objects are related to database tables. The categories are:
One-to-One: One record in a table maps to one record in another table.
One-to-Many: One record in a table maps to multiple records in another table.
Many-to-One: Multiple records in a table map to one record in another table.
Many-to-Many: Multiple records in one table map to multiple records in another table via a join table.

12. **What is cascading in JPA, and what are its types?**
- Answer: Cascading in JPA allows certain operations (e.g., persist, merge) to be automatically propagated from a parent entity to its associated child entities. Types of cascading include:
- PERSIST: Propagates the persist operation.
- MERGE: Propagates the merge operation.
- REMOVE: Propagates the remove operation.
- REFRESH: Propagates the refresh operation.
- DETACH: Propagates the detach operation.


13. **What are fetch types in JPA, and what are the differences between EAGER and LAZY fetching?**
- Answer: Fetch types determine how associated entities are loaded.
- EAGER: The associated entities are loaded immediately with the parent entity.
- LAZY: The associated entities are loaded on-demand, only when accessed.


14. **What is Thymeleaf, and can you provide some examples of its use?**
- Answer: Thymeleaf is a Java-based templating engine used for rendering HTML and other text formats. Examples include:
- Displaying dynamic content: <p th:text="${message}">Hello, World!</p>
- Iterating over a list: <ul th:each="item : ${items}"><li th:text="${item}"></li></ul>


15. **What are fragments in Thymeleaf, and how are they used?**
- Answer: Fragments in Thymeleaf are reusable sections of HTML that can be included in other templates. They allow you to define common parts like headers or footers in one place. Usage example:
- Defining a fragment: <div th:fragment="header">Header Content</div>
- Including a fragment: <div th:replace="fragments/header :: header"></div>


16. **What are entities in JPA?**
- Answer: Entities in JPA are Java classes annotated with @Entity, representing database tables. Each instance of an entity corresponds to a row in the table, and fields in the entity map to columns in the table.


17. **What is Lombok, and how does it help in Java development?**
- Answer: Lombok is a Java library that reduces boilerplate code by using annotations to automatically generate methods like getters, setters, constructors, and toString. For example, @Getter and @Setter automatically generate getter and setter methods for fields.


18. **Why is it important to create separate data access and service layers in a Spring Boot application?**
- Answer: Separating the data access and service layers promotes modularity, maintainability, and separation of concerns. The data access layer handles database interactions, while the service layer contains business logic and orchestrates interactions between the data access layer and other parts of the application. This separation helps in managing and scaling the application effectively.
